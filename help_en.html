    <p>
      Map editing consists of two stages: map setting and “support” provinces marking. Result map
      image can be copied to the clipboard, saved to a file, or published on the website imgbb.com.
    </p>

    <h2>Map setting.</h2>
    <p>
      First of all, it is necessary to setup guild headquarters (sign and select the color of the
      guild), and also check and set the number of spaces for buildings (for sieges) in the sectors.
    </p>
    <p>
      To enter the editor, right-click on the desired sector. To set a province as a headquarters,
      enter the name of the guild, check the "headquarters" selection and choice the guild color.
      For other provinces, check the number of buildings for sieges (to select the number of places
      for buildings, click on the corresponding button). To save your changes, press SAVE (or ENTER
      on your keyboard). Cancel - CANCEL (or ESC). After completing the settings, the map can be
      saved to database of site <u>jsonbin.io</u>. You will get special ID of the map. This ID can
      be used by another player to continue editing. Otherway you can save map as file and sent to
      another player. Finally you can publish map as image on server <u>imgbb.com</u> to share it
      with your GBG partners.
    </p>

    <h2>Marking of “support” provinces.</h2>
    <p>
      To select Guild click on the headquarters. Then mark provinces that you plan to assign as
      supporters for the selected guild. Clicking again cancels the selection.
